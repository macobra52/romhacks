Super Calm Bros. 3
=================

Unless otherwise stated, the following patches should be applied to the
base Super Calm Bros nes file (e.g. for me: `Super_Calm_Bros_1.1.nes`)

base patch
-------------

`Super_Calm_Bros_1.1.ips` will patch the base Super Mario Bros 3 game

nolocks
-------
`Super_Calm_Bros_1.1_nolocks.ips` will remove all locks and stones from
the world map to allow the player to access different areas of the game.

Practice rom
------------

`Super_Calm_Bros_1.1_practice.ips` will create a complete practice rom for
super calm bros 3. It grants the following:
From super calm bros 3 patches: nolocks (remove locks and world 8 rock)
From super mario bros 3 patches: allitems, start from any world
(at title screen hold down to scroll through a menu), quickdeaths, skip levels
