Super Riff Bros. 3
==================

Practice rom
------------

`Super_Riff_Bros._3 v1.21_practice.ips` is a patch (on the PRG0 SMB3 rom) that
will create a practice rom for super riff bros 3. It allows the user to enter
all the levels across two screens. The first screen is all vanilla levels, and
the second screen has star world, forts, and other levels.
